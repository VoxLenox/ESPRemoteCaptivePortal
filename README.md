# ESP Remote Captive Portal
This is a simple program made for ESP boards. It allows you to create your own captive portal server without the need to hard-code it into your ESP board.
# üõ†Ô∏è Getting started
## üíæ Installation
There are two ways to install this:
### 1. Use prebuilt binaries
* Download the correct binary file for your ESP board [here](https://github.com/VoxLenox/ESPRemoteCaptivePortal/tree/main/bin).
* Use an software to upload the firmware into your ESP board. Here are some of my recommendations [esp.huhn.me](https://esp.huhn.me), [NodeMCU Flasher](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher), [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool).
### 2. Compile the program by yourself
* Download Arduino IDE or any IDE that have the ability compile/upload firmwares if you haven't.
* Ensure that you have all of these dependencies installed: [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson), [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer), [StreamUtils](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoStreamUtils).
* Select and download the correct source code for your ESP board from [here](https://github.com/VoxLenox/ESPRemoteCaptivePortal/tree/main/src) and open it in your IDE.
* Connect the ESP board to your device.
* Compile then upload the firmware into your ESP board.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up
Here are the steps to setup this program after installation:
* Connect to the Wi-Fi access point named `"ESPRCP"` (There are no password).
* Open your browser and head to this url: [http://192.168.4.1:8000](http://192.168.4.1:8000)
* Login using the following the username `"manager"` and password `"12345678"`.
* Configure your access point and captive portal address, remember to change the username and password of manager account as well.
* Click the "Save" button.
* Use any software or programming languages that you familiar with and start creating a local web server on your device (laptop, android, ...) at the address you set earlier, whenever a new device connect to your access point they will be redirect to your server.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
* Avoid using the save or reset button in the manager page TOO often, it might affect your EEPROM life cycle.
* There are several settings that I'm not recommend touching without knowing what you're doing: local IP address, gateway, subnet mask, max connections, beacon interval.
* Do not mess with the backend APIs because it does not validate the data you send, messing with it might cause the access point or manager panel become inaccessible and you will have to do a reinstallation.
* Will add support for other boards in future.
* I'll continue develop this if it worth to invest ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
